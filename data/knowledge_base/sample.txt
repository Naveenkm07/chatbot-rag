Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI models. RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base and then use a language model to generate answers or summaries based on both the retrieved context and the user query. This approach improves factual accuracy and allows the model to access up-to-date or domain-specific information beyond its training data.

Key benefits of RAG include:
- Enhanced accuracy and relevance of responses
- Ability to cite sources or context
- Scalability to large knowledge bases

Popular vector databases for RAG include ChromaDB, Pinecone, and FAISS. Embedding models like Sentence Transformers are used to convert text into vector representations for efficient similarity search.
